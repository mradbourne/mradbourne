# Welcome to my code stash!


## A bit about me
I'm a full-stack software developer with a strong background in user-centred design. Having a lot of experience in both of these fields allows me to involve real users throughout the design process and build great digital products.

I work in the Fintech industry, creating software to enable responsible and ethical investing. I hope this work does a bit of good for the world.

Some things you may not know about me:
- I blog about software development and user-centred design at [radbourne.net](https://radbourne.net).
- I love [a good hackathon or game jam](https://itch.io/profile/mradbourne).
- [I produce audio for indie games](https://soundcloud.com/mradbourne) in my spare time.
- I have helped teach User Experience Design at General Assembly.
