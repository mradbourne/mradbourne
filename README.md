# ▶️ Welcome to my code cave
### A bit about me...
I'm a full-stack software developer with a strong background in user-centred design. Having a lot of experience in both of these fields allows me to involve real users throughout the design process and build great digital products.

I work in the Fintech industry, creating software to enable responsible and ethical investing. I hope this work does a bit of good for the world.

Some things you may not know about me:
- I blog about software development and user-centred design at [usershaped.com](https://usershaped.com).
- I love [a good hackathon or game jam](https://itch.io/profile/mradbourne).
- [I produce audio for indie games](https://soundcloud.com/mradbourne) in my spare time.
- I have helped teach User Experience Design at General Assembly.
